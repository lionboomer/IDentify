# IDentify: Strengthening Web Application Security

Welcome to IDentify, a project aimed at enhancing web application security through innovative machine learning-powered device fingerprinting techniques.

## Introduction

IDentify leverages machine learning algorithms to bolster the security of web applications by identifying and tracking individual devices through device fingerprinting. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, expected outcomes, and more.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of IDentify are:
- Design and implement a JavaScript-based data collection module to gather comprehensive device attributes.
- Build machine learning models to refine device fingerprinting accuracy and reduce false positives.
- Develop an AI-based anomaly detection system to flag suspicious changes in device fingerprints, potentially indicating malicious activity.

## Methodology

IDentify employs a comprehensive methodology that includes:
- JavaScript implementation for data collection, capturing WebGL properties, canvas fingerprinting, browser features, font detection, CPU and hardware specifications, and behavioral patterns.
- Integration of machine learning models for classification and anomaly detection.
- Security and privacy considerations such as transparency, data minimization, secure storage and handling, and compliance with relevant regulations.

## Expected Outcomes and Impact

The expected outcomes and impact of IDentify include:
- Enhanced security by strengthening user identification beyond conventional authentication methods.
- Fraud prevention by making it harder to spoof or impersonate legitimate devices.
- Improved user experience through potential reduction of friction in authentication processes for known and trusted devices.
